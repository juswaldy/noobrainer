Imagine you are an otherwise healthy 30-something who starts feeling weird. You are sometimes short of breath. You get migraines. Your feet start to swell a little. But otherwise, everything seems fine. You go to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests. She tells you, It's probably nothing, but these could be signs of a coming heart attack.

On Friday, Colts GM Ryan Grigson, who is under fire for the Colts 1-3 start, said that it's difficult to build up the team's defense with Luck making so much money. According to Keefer, Grigson did point out that the Colts still have young talent they're hoping to develop on defense. However, blaming Luck's contract — which the Colts gave him — for having a weak defense (30th in defensive DVOA) is not accurate.

They destroyed the microwaves and dishwasher, and broke the sprinklers. After they ruined one room and started a flood, they rammed their way into another and continued their rampage.

Many bankers and politicians predicted Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum would prompt a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London’s position in global finance.  But the number of jobs UK-based financial institutions say they actually expect to shift overseas has fallen steeply from the 5,766 predicted to move in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the last survey in September. This new estimate is about a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in the first survey in September 2017.   A no-deal Brexit would mean Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement on trade.

In case of physical disruption, we are ready to act in an appropriate way,” Birol told a news conference at the IEA’s annual energy efficiency conference in Dublin.

Some of the FDA candidates he’s identified — including Silicon Valley’s Jim O’Neill and Balaji Srinivasan — have similarly argued that the agency should dump its requirement that drugs be proven effective before reaching the market, and that we’d be better off if the FDA operated more like a “Yelp for drugs.” In other words, bringing the same speedy and disruptive approach to medical regulation that Silicon Valley brought to the taxi and hotel industries, for example, wil...</td>\n",

The IPO could take place in October, one of the people said. The firm is expected to be valued at several billion Swiss francs.  Credit Suisse and SoftwareONE declined to comment. UBS and JPMorgan could not immediately be reached for comment.  Since taking over German IT firm Comparex earlier this year, SoftwareONE employs around 5,500 people. The company, headquartered in Stans, Switzerland, helps companies manage an estimated 10 billion euros in software purchases from vendors such as Microsoft, Adobe and IBM. In 2015, KKR acquired a 25 percent stake in the company, the majority of which ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Software companies are contributing an outsized share of growth to the U.S. economy — and not just in Silicon Valley. The software industry represented just 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 but 7 percent of GDP growth from 2014 to 2016, according to U.S. government data compiled by Software.org: the BSA Foundation, part of a trade group that represents big companies like Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce. Meanwhile, software jobs increased about 14 percent from 2014 to 2016, outpacing overall U.S. job growth of about 4 percent. One big takeaway: Yes, the software industry is still growing in places like Silicon Valley, where the fastest-growing big tech companies — like Apple, Google and Facebook — have traditionally located their headquarters and dollars. The top states for absolute job growth are California, Texas and New York, as well as Virginia, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida — all states with big population centers and established tech industries.

What was striking about putting together a list of people who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct in recent months was not necessarily the prevalence of the problem — unfortunately, women and gender-nonconforming people have long been aware of the sheer ubiquity of sexual harassment and violence. What was surprising — what felt new about this time in American history — was that of 105 people Vox included on the list, more than 50 have faced legal or professional consequences, from job suspensions to jail time. It’s too soon to tell what the long-term impact of #MeToo will be, but in a number of individual cases, it has produced swift action. And yet perhaps the most powerful man on the list — President Donald Trump — so far has avoided any consequences at all.

Imagine you are an otherwise healthy 30-something who starts feeling weird. You are sometimes short of breath. You get migraines. Your feet start to swell a little. But otherwise, everything seems fine. You go to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests. She tells you, It's probably nothing, but these could be signs of a coming heart attack. You push for more certainty, but the doctor tells you she's not sure. The human body is a complex system. You're young and otherwise pretty healthy. There could be plenty of other explanations for what you're feeling. But it is a little worrying. So just to be on the safe side, maybe you should reduce the stress in your life and eat a healthier diet. What would you do? If you're a sensible person, you'd probably err on the side of precaution. Sure, it might be nothing ...  \n",
       "1    The Indianapolis Colts made Andrew Luck the highest-paid player in NFL history this offseason with a five-year, $122-million contract with $89 million guaranteed. However, they're already finding that Luck's contract is inhibiting their ability to address weaknesses on other parts of the roster, particularly on defense. On Friday, Colts GM Ryan Grigson, who is under fire for the Colts 1-3 start, said that it's difficult to build up the team's defense with Luck making so much money. According to Keefer, Grigson did point out that the Colts still have young talent they're hoping to develop on defense. However, blaming Luck's contract — which the Colts gave him — for having a weak defense (30th in defensive DVOA) is not accurate. As others have pointed out, last year's Denver Broncos paid Peyton Manning $15 million in base salary while also boasting an elite defense. Luck also takes up $18.4 million against the salary cap this year, less than $1 million more than Manning did a year a...  \n",

       "3   PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy published a new memoir on Thursday but was quick to dismiss speculation he might return to politics to rescue his old center-right party, which has shed support since President Emmanuel Macron stormed to power.  Entitled “Passions”, the autobiography documents Sarkozy’s rise to power, while hurling barbs at some of his former allies, including his prime minister Francois Fillon.  During his time in office from 2007-2012, Sarkozy earned the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his brash style and close association with tycoons and celebrities.

This feeling of ‘flow’ or being ‘in the zone’ is something that most of us have experienced at some point or other—although not as often as we might like. It’s a mental state that elite athletes seem to have at their beck and call. For us mere mortals, though, it hardly ever shows up when we need it. Since the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi first described the zone (which he called ‘flow’) in 1975, neuroscientists have been trying to figure out what it is and how to make it show up on demand.

       "11  (Reuters) - The success of Hudson’s Bay Co Executive Chairman Richard Baker’s $1.3 billion bid to take the department store operator private hinges on whether an independent valuator will view the company more as a retailer and less as a real estate owner, corporate governance experts and analysts said.  Much of Hudson’s Bay’s value is locked up in its real estate. Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash, it could fetch more than what Baker offered, but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores.  Baker’s buyout consortium, which already owns 57% of Hudson’s Bay, has made a C$9.45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company, a 48% premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement.

Many bankers and politicians predicted Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum would prompt a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London’s position in global finance.  But the number of jobs UK-based financial institutions say they actually expect to shift overseas has fallen steeply from the 5,766 predicted to move in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the last survey in September. This new estimate is about a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in the first survey in September 2017.   A no-deal Brexit would mean Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement on trade.

       "29  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping season showed the increasing preference for online purchases, as more Americans opted to stay home and use their smartphones while sales and traffic at brick-and-mortar stores declined.  The ongoing shift to online shopping has forced retailers across the country to invest heavily in boosting their e-commerce businesses, and also highlights the impact of early holiday promotions and year-round deals on consumer spending.  The weekend also redefined the importance of Black Friday. For the past few years, Black Friday was believed to be waning in importance, but it is now turning into a day when shoppers do not necessarily flock to stores but spend heavily online.   Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, said online sales are starting to complement in-store shopping over the weekend, and for shoppers and retailers the two platforms are starting to converge.

Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) began an offensive in early April to take Tripoli from fighters loyal to Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj’s Government of National Accord (GNA) which has the backing of the United Nations.  The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, has not been able to breach the southern defenses of Tripoli. The fighting has killed at least 510 people, forced 75,000 out of their homes and trapped thousands of migrants in detention centers.   “Of course, the political solution is still the goal. But to get back to politics, we must first finish with militias,” Haftar told the newspaper.

There’s no exaggerating it: This is the biggest legislative event of 2017 so far, inaugurating the final stretch of debate over a law poised to achieve one of the GOP’s dearest priorities: repealing and replacing Obamacare. But even though the effort has been going on for weeks, the bill release Thursday will be the first time much of the media has treated it like an urgent news event.

       "33  (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted mixed U.S. sales results for June and the second quarter, with demand still fairly strong for SUVs and pickup trucks while passenger car sales continued a long-running decline.  In the pickup truck segment, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s (FCA) (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) Ram outsold General Motors Co’s (GM.N) Chevrolet Silverado in the second quarter. GM reports sales on a quarterly instead of monthly basis.  The Silverado has long held second place behind Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) F-Series pickup trucks, with Ram often a distant third. But so far in 2019, FCA’s sales of Ram pickups have outpaced Chevy Silverado sales by more than 40,000 vehicles.

But on the eve of the vice presidential debate, it decided to attack Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine for carrying out a constitutional duty. The Republican National Committee debuted a TV ad Monday that attacks Kaine for representing convicted criminals as a civil rights lawyer in Richmond (as well as selectively highlighting his record as governor to make him seem more generous with clemency than he actually was). As the ad’s narration puts it, Kaine “constantly protected the worst kinds of people.” Sure he did. Someone had to. The Constitution says so. Attacking Kaine for fulfilling a constitutional duty isn’t just an expression of hypocrisy, though.

Expressed by the artist herself? From Cubism to conceptual art, the 20th century saw a spike in the appropriation of words in visual expression. Of course, there are earlier examples, like illuminated manuscripts, Egyptian hieroglyphs, or the works of visual poets like William Blake. But it was in the 1960s especially that the boundaries between the seemingly distinct art forms really began to blur. Marcel Broodthaers was a product of this time. Currently having a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Belgian is hailed for being innovative with written and visual language, borrowing from Marcel Duchamp, René Magritte (a contemporary and ...  \n",

Wade. That ruling found that certain state laws outlawing abortion were an unconstitutional violation of a woman’s right to privacy, effectively legalizing abortion nationwide.  “I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence, the right to life,” Trump said in remarks recorded in the Oval Office, a right he said extended to “unborn children.”   Vice President Mike Pence appeared onstage at the rally to introduce the video, calling Trump, who before entering politics said he supported abortion access, “the most pro-life president in American history.”   During his 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to ...  \n",
       "87  LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Despite promising a decade ago to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, the world’s leading economies more than doubled subsidies to coal-fired power plants over three years, putting climate goals at risk, energy researchers said Tuesday.  Between 2014 and 2017, G20 governments more than halved direct support for coal mining, from $22 billion to about $10 billion on average each year, according to a report by the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a think tank.  But over the same period they boosted backing for coal-fired power plants - particularly supporting construction of the plants in other, often poorer nations - from $17 billion to $47 billion a year, the report noted.  China and Japan - which will host a G20 summit later this week in Osaka - were the biggest providers of public finance for coal-fired power, followed by South Korea and India, it said.   While spending from national budgets on coal fell, as did tax breaks for i...  \n",
       "88  Aly Raisman and her Team USA teammates are heroically disrupting a dangerous belief system that athletes must blindly trust their coaches and doctors -- so says fellow Olympian Adam Rippon. The Team USA figure skating star says he's so proud of Aly, Simone Biles and others for refusing to be victims -- and instead, uniting to change the culture for the better. \"I think when you're an athlete and you have somebody who's in power, you feel like they're in the right,\" Rippon says. \"You're in that position where you wanna listen to them. You want to do everything that they tell you to do, even if it sounds wrong. You still do it because that's what you're told. You want to be the best.\" Obviously, it was that mentality that explains why so many girls and young women stayed quiet about the abuse they suffered at the hands of team doctor Larry Nassar, who sexually assaulted more than 180 women under the guise of performing medical techniques. \"There were people [like Larry Nassar] that r...  \n",
       "89  While most Americans were preparing for a long July 4th weekend, Aaron Regunberg, a policy adviser to Rhode Island Mayor Jorge Elorza, was getting arrested outside an ICE detention center in Providence. That was by design.  Leading liberal politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been slammed for conflating migrant detention centers with concentration camps, but a growing number of American Jews like Regunberg are pushing back with a message of their own: Yes, they're concentration camps, and we must stop them now. Invoking the Holocaust, they have been protesting outside ICE detention centers across the country, chanting \"Never Again for Anyone.\" “Never Again isn’t just about remembering how the Holocaust ended. It’s also about how it started, with a gradual process of legal exclusion and state-sponsored dehumanization that led eventually to the deaths of my grandpa’s family and so many millions of others,” Rugenberg, whose relatives were murdered in the Holoca...  \n",

       "91  Brian Sandoval, the moderate Republican governor of Nevada who also happens to have been a federal judge before becoming governor, has been floated by both of his home state's senators as a possible compromise Supreme Court appointment. The White House is apparently taking the idea seriously enough to have commenced some formal vetting to see if there's some big reason other than the obvious partisan politics angles not to do this. But then there are the obvious partisan political angles. If literally everything about American politics in 2016 were different, filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of an iconic conservative justice with a moderate Republican could be a sensible compromise between a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate. But in the actual politics of 2016 it seems so obviously doomed as to be hardly worth trying — though floating Sandoval's name in the press as a way to bait Republicans into batting it down could be a savvy strategy for D...  \n",
       "92  CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump’s campaign.  The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump’s pro-drilling energy platform.   Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump’s campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was “the leading contender” for the position.   Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party’s candidate in the Nov. 8 pre...  \n",
       "93  COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh — “My mother was killed after the military set my home and village on fire,” 8-year-old Yasmin Noor said.  She’s one of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya children who escaped a vicious military campaign by Myanmar’s armed forces in late August that saw houses burned to the ground and widespread rape used as a weapon. The United Nations has since described the campaign as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” with the organization’s human rights chief telling reporters Tuesday he could not rule out “elements of genocide.” Some 625,000 Rohingya have converged on the small fishing village of Cox’s Bazar since August. Sixty percent of them are children, according to UNICEF. There had already been some 200,000 Rohingya refugees living in the border village before September’s massive influx. In total, more than 830,000 refugees are now living in two sprawling camps across Cox’s Bazaar.  Read more: A Rohingya refugee recalls her escape from Myanmar This sud...  \n",

       "96  Software companies are contributing an outsized share of growth to the U.S. economy — and not just in Silicon Valley. The software industry represented just 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 but 7 percent of GDP growth from 2014 to 2016, according to U.S. government data compiled by Software.org: the BSA Foundation, part of a trade group that represents big companies like Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce. Meanwhile, software jobs increased about 14 percent from 2014 to 2016, outpacing overall U.S. job growth of about 4 percent. One big takeaway: Yes, the software industry is still growing in places like Silicon Valley, where the fastest-growing big tech companies — like Apple, Google and Facebook — have traditionally located their headquarters and dollars. The top states for absolute job growth are California, Texas and New York, as well as Virginia, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida — all states with big population centers and established tech industries.

What was striking about putting together a list of people who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct in recent months was not necessarily the prevalence of the problem — unfortunately, women and gender-nonconforming people have long been aware of the sheer ubiquity of sexual harassment and violence. What was surprising — what felt new about this time in American history — was that of 105 people Vox included on the list, more than 50 have faced legal or professional consequences, from job suspensions to jail time. It’s too soon to tell what the long-term impact of #MeToo will be, but in a number of individual cases, it has produced swift action. And yet perhaps the most powerful man on the list — President Donald Trump — so far has avoided any consequences at all. Trump has been accused of sexual harassment, assault, or other misco...  "

On Friday, Colts GM Ryan Grigson, who is under fire for the Colts 1-3 start, said that it's difficult to build up the team's defense with Luck making so much money. According to Keefer, Grigson did point out that the Colts still have young talent they're hoping to develop on defense. However, blaming Luck's contract — which the Colts gave him — for having a weak defense (30th in defensive DVOA) is not accurate.

Entitled “Passions”, the autobiography documents Sarkozy’s rise to power, while hurling barbs at some of his former allies, including his prime minister Francois Fillon.  During his time in office from 2007-2012, Sarkozy earned the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his brash style and close association with tycoons and celebrities. While at the Elysee, he met and married former model Carla Bruni.  “Passions” is released as France’s center-right fights for survival two years after President Emmanuel Macron’s election win dynamited the political landscape.

Much of Hudson’s Bay’s value is locked up in its real estate. Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash, it could fetch more than what Baker offered, but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores.  Baker’s buyout consortium, which already owns 57% of Hudson’s Bay, has made a C$9.45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company, a 48% premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement.

In the pickup truck segment, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s (FCA) (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) Ram outsold General Motors Co’s (GM.N) Chevrolet Silverado in the second quarter. GM reports sales on a quarterly instead of monthly basis.  The Silverado has long held second place behind Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) F-Series pickup trucks, with Ram often a distant third. But so far in 2019, FCA’s sales of Ram pickups have outpaced Chevy Silverado sales by more than 40,000 vehicles.    FCA, GM and Ford escalated a price war in June over pickup trucks - one of few vehicle market segments offering substantial profits, which matters at a time when overall U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to fall this year.

Canada has faced years of delay in getting new oil pipelines built because of environmental opposition, resulting in severe congestion in Alberta, the country’s main crude-producing province, that forced the provincial government to impose production cuts this year. Pipelines face increasing scrutiny from environmental groups worried about leaks, and U.S. Great Lakes states are taking a hard look at the risks.  The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on June 3 that the environmental impact statement for Enbridge’s Line 3 failed to properly address the spill risk in Lake Superior, imposing a fresh challenge to the company’s construction schedule.

It now prohibits people from taking others across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal sexual acts. The law was initially designed to prevent adults from transporting minors across state lines for sex. The law requires the suspect to have formed the intent to commit the act before taking the victim across state lines. Our sources say prosecutors are looking at at least one actress whom Weinstein flew from one state to another. The stretch is that they will have to prove he asked the actress to travel, knowing that he was going to rape her when she arrived at the destination. The difficulty in such a case ...

Imagine you are an otherwise healthy 30-something who starts feeling weird. You are sometimes short of breath. You get migraines. Your feet start to swell a little. But otherwise, everything seems fine. You go to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests. She tells you, It's probably nothing, but these could be signs of a coming heart attack. You push for more certainty, but the doctor tells you she's not sure. The human body is a complex system. You're young and otherwise pretty healthy. There could be plenty of other explanations for what you're feeling. But it is a little worrying. So just to be on the safe side, maybe you should reduce the stress in your life and eat a healthier diet. What would you do? If you're a sensible person, you'd probably err on the side of precaution. Sure, it might be nothing ...   \n",
       "1    The Indianapolis Colts made Andrew Luck the highest-paid player in NFL history this offseason with a five-year, $122-million contract with $89 million guaranteed. However, they're already finding that Luck's contract is inhibiting their ability to address weaknesses on other parts of the roster, particularly on defense. On Friday, Colts GM Ryan Grigson, who is under fire for the Colts 1-3 start, said that it's difficult to build up the team's defense with Luck making so much money. According to Keefer, Grigson did point out that the Colts still have young talent they're hoping to develop on defense. However, blaming Luck's contract — which the Colts gave him — for having a weak defense (30th in defensive DVOA) is not accurate. As others have pointed out, last year's Denver Broncos paid Peyton Manning $15 million in base salary while also boasting an elite defense. Luck also takes up $18.4 million against the salary cap this year, less than $1 million more than Manning did a year a...   \n",

       "3   PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy published a new memoir on Thursday but was quick to dismiss speculation he might return to politics to rescue his old center-right party, which has shed support since President Emmanuel Macron stormed to power.  Entitled “Passions”, the autobiography documents Sarkozy’s rise to power, while hurling barbs at some of his former allies, including his prime minister Francois Fillon.  During his time in office from 2007-2012, Sarkozy earned the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his brash style and close association with tycoons and celebrities. While at the Elysee, he met and married former model Carla Bruni.  “Passions” is released as France’s center-right fights for survival two years after President Emmanuel Macron’s election win dynamited the political landscape.  Sarkozy’s old party, Les Republicains, is locked in infighting and struggling to find direction, squeezed by Macron’s centrist party and the far right.  “The boo...   \n",

A so-called tiered deposit rate would mean banks are exempted in part from paying the ECB’s 0.40 percent annual charge on their excess reserves, boosting their profits as they struggle with an unexpected growth slowdown  “We would have to consider whether a tiering system is needed,” Coeure said in an interview with the Financial Times. “Today the prevailing view in the Governing Council is that it is not, but we also agree that it deserves further reflection.”  Reporting by Michelle Martin\\nEditing by Tassilo Hummel   \n",

This feeling of ‘flow’ or being ‘in the zone’ is something that most of us have experienced at some point or other—although not as often as we might like. It’s a mental state that elite athletes seem to have at their beck and call. For us mere mortals, though, it hardly ever shows up when we need it. Since the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi first described the zone (which he called ‘flow’) in 1975, neuroscientists have been trying to figure out what it is and how to make it show up on demand. Yet as they close in on the secrets of the zone, another truth has emerged: What we think of as  the zone is actually one of many mental states that a person can be...   \n",

Experts told VICE News that Chinese state media’s adoption of the term appears to directly borrow from the U.S. president. Referring to the state-run Xinhua news agency report, Zhang Baohui, a political scientist at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said that “Xinhua’s usage of this term should be attributed to Trump.” China is just the latest country to adopt Trump’s favorite buzzword to discredit unfavorable reports; Russia and Iran have also begun using the term to dismiss critica...   \n",

       "11  (Reuters) - The success of Hudson’s Bay Co Executive Chairman Richard Baker’s $1.3 billion bid to take the department store operator private hinges on whether an independent valuator will view the company more as a retailer and less as a real estate owner, corporate governance experts and analysts said.  Much of Hudson’s Bay’s value is locked up in its real estate. Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash, it could fetch more than what Baker offered, but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores.  Baker’s buyout consortium, which already owns 57% of Hudson’s Bay, has made a C$9.45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company, a 48% premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement.

The Republican National Committee debuted a TV ad Monday that attacks Kaine for representing convicted criminals as a civil rights lawyer in Richmond (as well as selectively highlighting his record as governor to make him seem more generous with clemency than he actually was). As the ad’s narration puts it, Kaine “constantly protected the worst kinds of people.” Sure he did. Someone had to. The Constitution says so. Attacking Kaine for fulfilling a constitutional duty isn’t just an expression of hypocrisy, though. The ad — and its bungled rollout — are the clearest sign yet that Republicans who’ve embraced criminal justice reform, and tried to move past racially polarizing “tough on crime” politics, have lost the battle for the soul of their party. “Crim...   \n",

During a previous court appearance, on October 19, Kinsman had a scraggly beard, long hair, and wore a T-shirt and overalls.

       "91  Brian Sandoval, the moderate Republican governor of Nevada who also happens to have been a federal judge before becoming governor, has been floated by both of his home state's senators as a possible compromise Supreme Court appointment. The White House is apparently taking the idea seriously enough to have commenced some formal vetting to see if there's some big reason other than the obvious partisan politics angles not to do this. But then there are the obvious partisan political angles. If literally everything about American politics in 2016 were different, filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of an iconic conservative justice with a moderate Republican could be a sensible compromise between a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate. But in the actual politics of 2016 it seems so obviously doomed as to be hardly worth trying — though floating Sandoval's name in the press as a way to bait Republicans into batting it down could be a savvy strategy for D...   \n",
       "92  CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump’s campaign.  The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump’s pro-drilling energy platform.   Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump’s campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was “the leading contender” for the position.   Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party’s candidate in the Nov. 8 pre...   \n",
       "93  COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh — “My mother was killed after the military set my home and village on fire,” 8-year-old Yasmin Noor said.  She’s one of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya children who escaped a vicious military campaign by Myanmar’s armed forces in late August that saw houses burned to the ground and widespread rape used as a weapon. The United Nations has since described the campaign as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” with the organization’s human rights chief telling reporters Tuesday he could not rule out “elements of genocide.” Some 625,000 Rohingya have converged on the small fishing village of Cox’s Bazar since August. Sixty percent of them are children, according to UNICEF. There had already been some 200,000 Rohingya refugees living in the border village before September’s massive influx. In total, more than 830,000 refugees are now living in two sprawling camps across Cox’s Bazaar.  Read more: A Rohingya refugee recalls her escape from Myanmar This sud...   \n",

       "95  ZURICH, June 26 (Reuters) - Swiss software group SoftwareONE has mandated banks for an upcoming stock market flotation, sources told Reuters on Wednesday, paving the way for a potential multi-billion dollar listing this autumn.  Credit Suisse, UBS and JPMorgan have been hired to advise on the planned initial public offering as so-called global coordinators, sources familiar with the matter said. The IPO could take place in October, one of the people said. The firm is expected to be valued at several billion Swiss francs.  Credit Suisse and SoftwareONE declined to comment. UBS and JPMorgan could not immediately be reached for comment.  Since taking over German IT firm Comparex earlier this year, SoftwareONE employs around 5,500 people. The company, headquartered in Stans, Switzerland, helps companies manage an estimated 10 billion euros in software purchases from vendors such as Microsoft, Adobe and IBM.

       "96  Software companies are contributing an outsized share of growth to the U.S. economy — and not just in Silicon Valley. The software industry represented just 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 but 7 percent of GDP growth from 2014 to 2016, according to U.S. government data compiled by Software.org: the BSA Foundation, part of a trade group that represents big companies like Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce. Meanwhile, software jobs increased about 14 percent from 2014 to 2016, outpacing overall U.S. job growth of about 4 percent. One big takeaway: Yes, the software industry is still growing in places like Silicon Valley, where the fastest-growing big tech companies — like Apple, Google and Facebook — have traditionally located their headquarters and dollars. The top states for absolute job growth are California, Texas and New York, as well as Virginia, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida — all states with big population centers and established tech industries.

       "99  Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the company he co-founded. Matt Lauer is gone from NBC. Mario Batali has stepped away from his restaurants. What was striking about putting together a list of people who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct in recent months was not necessarily the prevalence of the problem — unfortunately, women and gender-nonconforming people have long been aware of the sheer ubiquity of sexual harassment and violence. What was surprising — what felt new about this time in American history — was that of 105 people Vox included on the list, more than 50 have faced legal or professional consequences, from job suspensions to jail time. It’s too soon to tell what the long-term impact of #MeToo will be, but in a number of individual cases, it has produced swift action. And yet perhaps the most powerful man on the list — President Donald Trump — so far has avoided any consequences at all. Trump has been accused of sexual harassment, assault, or other misco...   \n",
